ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Dhusitha
I am a dedicated and lifelong learner, currently pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering at Coimbatore Institute of Technology. With a keen eye for design and a love for coding, now I'm focusing on Front End Development. I thrive on challenges and I'm always eager to stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in the ever-evolving world of web development. From creating responsive layouts to optimizing performance, I enjoy every aspect of the front-end development process.
